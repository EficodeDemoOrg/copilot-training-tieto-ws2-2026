# 📋 Spec-Driven Development with OpenSpec

OpenSpec is a lightweight, AI-friendly workflow that captures proposed changes as versioned spec documents (proposal, deltas, tasks). The assistant reads these documents, implements against them, and then archives them — keeping intent, code, and history in sync.

## 🛠️ Installing OpenSpec

1. Install OpenSpec globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
    ```
2. Initialize OpenSpec in this repository:
    ```bash
    cd copilot-training-gantt-chart
    openspec init
    ```
3. Select GitHub Copilot from the menu.
4. Inspect the `.github/prompts` and `.github/skills` directories. You should see the OpenSpec tools listed there.
5. Without executing any commands, verify that the OpenSpec slash commands are available in chat by typing `/opsx-` and checking that the commands appear in the suggestion list.

## 🔄 The Default OpenSpec Workflow

OpenSpec offers two modes:
1. The default "quick path".
2. Expanded mode, which provides more granular workflows and additional tools.

In this exercise we use the default mode, where the workflow typically looks like this:

```
/openspec-new-change ──► /openspec-apply-change ──► /openspec-archive-change
```

For details, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/blob/main/docs/workflows.md).

## 🎯 Exercises

Let's use OpenSpec to specify and implement a feature that lets users add milestones to a chart.

1. Start by scaffolding a new change:
    ```
    /openspec-new-change The user can add milestones to the Gantt chart. A milestone is a zero-duration marker representing a key event (release, deadline, sign-off) rather than a span of work. It is rendered as a diamond marker, and hovering over it reveals a label with the milestone title.
    ```
2. After running `/openspec-new-change`, a new directory will appear under `openspec/changes`, likely named `add-milestones` or similar. OpenSpec will then start the process of creating proposal, design etc. artifacts inside the folder, one at a time. See through the whole process, answering any questions and progressing to the creation of the next artifact when prompted. Validating the files before continuing to the next file (at least skim them through to understand the contents). The files that OpenSpec will create are:
    - `proposal.md` — the "why" and "what": intent, scope, and approach.
    - `design.md` — the "how": technical approach and architecture decisions.
    - `tasks.md` — the implementation checklist with checkboxes.
    - `spec.md` -  the delta spec: a description of what is changing

4. At this point, review the design documents and make any necessary changes, either manually or with Copilot's assistance.
5. Apply the changes:
    ```
    /openspec-apply-change
    ```
    This starts the implementation based on the specs.
6. When the implementation finishes, verify the result in the browser.
7. Once you are satisfied with the implementation, archive the change:
    ```
    /openspec-archive-change
    ```
    Choose "sync now" when prompted.
8. Inspect the `openspec/specs` directory. The delta specs should now be part of the official specification — the source of truth for how the system works.
